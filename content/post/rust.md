The [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org "Rust Language")  has reached version 1.0.

I decided to spend some time learning and evaluating the Rust programming language from the perspective of resource orienting computing. 
Rust might seem like an unlikely candidate for ROC development because it designed to be a low level system programming language to compete with C and C++. 
I guess that is part of the intrigue for me - discovering if a modern, safe, fast programming language can serve as a foundation for the resource oriented computing approach.

If Rust is to serve as a ROC language it must be able to deal with resources as a general abstraction. And that's where I'll start - learning and experimenting with Rust as a way to model resources.
